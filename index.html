            <h4>Background on Information Technology</h4>
            <p>Information technology (IT) is a broad phrase that refers to the use of computers, software, networks, and other technologies to manage and process information. It has become an essential component of modern life, transforming how we work, communicate, and obtain information. The creation of early computing devices such as the abacus and mechanical calculators paved the way for the evolution of information technology. However, the contemporary era of IT began in the mid-twentieth century with the introduction of electronic computers. These early computers were large, expensive machines used primarily by governments, universities, and large corporations for tasks such as data processing and scientific calculations. This era also saw the rise of e-commerce, social media, and other online services, which transformed various industries and aspects of everyday life.</p>
